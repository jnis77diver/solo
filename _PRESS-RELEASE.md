(http://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management).
It is reproduced here for posterities sake.

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer,
rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be
applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product.
The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal
users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions
(internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built).
Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound
like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs.
Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other
business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that
if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline
for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're
sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience.
That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team
can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things
that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused
on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain,
and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
TRACK CONVERSIONS FOR FACEBOOK ADS IF YOU ARE USING A WEBSITE WITH PAYPAL BUTTONS

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
For website owners whose products are sold using Paypal buttons where payment is accepted on the Paypal website.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph
  good.
"Facebook Ads Tracking for Paypal" implements Paypal's Instant Payment Notification (NPI) API to get the data from
a payment conversion on a website that uses Paypal buttons for payment and sends the data back to Facebook if the lead
source for the purchase was Facebook Ads.


## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
So you started using Facebook Ads to direct potential customers to your website where you are using Paypal buttons
for the sale and payment of the product. The only thing is, you realize that Facebook relies on redirecting customers
after a purchase to a Thank You page on your website to accurately track conversions (people who click on an ad and
make it all the way through the payment process). But Paypal doesn't automatically redirect customers to your
Thank You page after payment and there isn't a reliable option that will take care of this through Paypal. So, may
find that your conversion tracking on Facebook Ads are innaccurate. And how can you calculate your Return On Investment
for your Facebook Advertising if you don't have good data. You need another way to track this.
Enter "Facebook Ads Tracking for Paypal".

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
"Facebook Ads Tracking for Paypal" knows when a product purchase came from a Facebook Ad lead source and sends the
  data back to Paypal in real time so Facebook's conversion tracking is accurate.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
"We created Facebook Ads Tracking for Paypal out of our own frustration using Facebook ads with a simple website
  that was using Paypal buttons. There have to be millions of small website owners out there using the same Paypal
  buttons to sell products and they are basically forced to use Facebook Ads in the blind without having accurate
  conversion tracking or simply forego using Facebook."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
To get started, all you have to do is create an account, add your Paypal IPN # and click test.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
"I was going to stop using Facebook Ads because I had no idea how well they were performing. Were my sales coming from
  the Ads or from organic traffic? Then I saw FACEBOOK ADS TRACKING FOR PAYPAL and I decided to give it a try. It
  definitely fills the gap for Facebook."
